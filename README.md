# Copilot Chat

Filename | My usage
--- | ---
utils.py | I use this to show some of the core features of Copilot Chat. The file comes from the awesome [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3surPGP7_4o) that Allison (@2percentsilk) recorded. Watch the video for the use cases.
parse_expenses.py | Also from the awesome video mentioned in the previous row
test.asm | I like to show Copilot Chat translating this Assembly language into Python
genericListener.cob | I usually show Copilot Chat translating this COBOL into Java
vulnerable.php | I ask Copilot Chat if this code is secure. It tell me that it's not. I then ask Copilot Chat to fix the code.
